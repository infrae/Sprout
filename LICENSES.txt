Sprout is copyright Infrae and distributed under the BSD license (see
doc/licenses/BSD.txt), with the following exceptions:

test.py, the test-runner script, is GPL and copyright Shuttleworth
Foundation. See doc/licenses/GPL.txt. It is believed the unchanged
inclusion of test.py to run the unit test suite falls under the
"aggregation" clause of the GPL and thus does not affect the license
of the rest of the package.

sprout.saxext.generator is an improved version of the generator in the
Python standard library. It is copyright PSF and comes under the
Python license, detailed in doc/licenses/PythonLicense.txt.
